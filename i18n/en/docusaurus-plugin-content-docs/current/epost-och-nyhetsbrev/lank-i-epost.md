# Link in Email

You can link to a FOTO-3DÂ© viewer directly in an email or newsletter. It's a simple and effective way to let the recipient open the viewer in a new window â€” for example, from a newsletter, campaign email, or personal outreach.

---

## Important to Know

> If you're sending a regular email (e.g., via Gmail or Outlook), **pasting HTML code** like `<a href="...">` will **not** work.  
> In that case, it will just appear as plain text. To create a clickable link, you need to use your email programâ€™s **insert link** function.

## How to Do It â€“ Manually in Gmail

1. Write something like: `View the product in 3D`
2. Highlight the text
3. Click **Insert link** (the chain icon ðŸ”—)
4. Paste the link:  
   `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`
5. Click **OK**

*In most cases, Gmail automatically recognizes a link.*

## If You're Using an Email Tool

If you're using a mailing tool like **Mailchimp**, **Brevo**, or similar, you can choose to:

- Use their **visual editor** (highlight text â†’ add link)
- Or, if you're comfortable with it, use their **HTML block** to paste in HTML code directly:

```html
<a href="https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View the product in 3D</a>
```

---

## What Does `target="_blank"` Do?

It opens the link in a new window or tab, allowing the recipient to continue reading the email afterward.

---

## Compatibility

- Clickable text links work in all modern email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.)
- If the recipient can't view HTML (rare), it's a good idea to also display the full link:

```
https://v.marvify.io/?m=<modell-id>
```
