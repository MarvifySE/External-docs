## Using FOTO-3D on Facebook

### You’ll need:
- A shareable link (URL) to your FOTO-3D© model  
  Example: `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`
- A Facebook account with access to a business page

---

### Here's how:

1. Log in to **[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/)**
2. Go to your **business page**
3. Click **“Create post”**
4. Write a short description, for example:  
   > Explore our new packaging in 3D – rotate, zoom, and see every detail!
5. Paste your FOTO-3D link directly into the text field, e.g.:
   ```
   https://v.marvify.io/?m=<modell-id>
   ```
Facebook will automatically display a clickable link in the post.

*If you've purchased the social media package, an image with a description will also be shown.*
6. Click **“Publish”**

---

### Tips:
- Feel free to add a product image or screenshot along with the link to grab attention.  
- Keep the text short and action-oriented, e.g., “View in 3D” or “Explore directly in your browser.”
