## Using FOTO-3D on LinkedIn

### You’ll need:
- A shareable link (URL) to your FOTO-3D© model  
  Example: `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`
- A LinkedIn account (business or personal)


---

### Here's how:

1. Log in to **[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)**  
2. Go to your **company page** or **profile**  
3. Click **“Start a post”**  
4. Write a short introduction, for example:  
   > “We’re launching new packaging – see it in 3D right in your browser!”
5. Paste the link to your FOTO-3D model directly into the text field:  
   ```
   https://v.marvify.io/?m=<modell-id>
   ```
6. LinkedIn will automatically make the link clickable in the post.  
7. Click **“Post”**

### Tips:
- Feel free to add an image or screenshot along with the link to attract attention.  
- You can also comment on others’ posts and include a FOTO-3D link as part of your response.
