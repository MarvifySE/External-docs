## Using FOTO-3D on X (formerly Twitter)

### You’ll need:
- A shareable link (URL) to your FOTO-3D© model  
  Example: `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`
- An account on X (https://x.com)

---

### Here's how:

1. Log in to **[X](https://x.com)**  
2. Click **“Post”** (formerly “Tweet”)  
3. Write a short post, for example: 
``` 
   > How cool is it to spin our new packaging in 3D?  
   > See for yourself: https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>
```
4. Paste your FOTO-3D link directly into the text. It will become clickable automatically.  
5. Click **“Post”**

---

### Tips:
- You can add an image or emoji to draw attention to the post.  
- Shorter posts with a direct link work well on the platform.  
- Feel free to use hashtags relevant to your product or industry.
