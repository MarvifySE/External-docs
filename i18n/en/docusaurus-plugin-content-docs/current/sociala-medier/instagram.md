## Using FOTO-3D on Instagram

### You’ll need:
- A shareable link (URL) to your FOTO-3D© model  
  Example: `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`
- An Instagram account (a business account is recommended for more features)

---

### Here's how:

1. Log in to **[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com)**
2. Decide where you want to use the link – see the options below:

---

### **Option 1: Add the link to your bio**

Instagram only allows one clickable link in your profile (bio).

1. Go to your profile page  
2. Tap **“Edit Profile”**  
3. Paste your FOTO-3D link into the **“Website”** field  
4. Tap **“Done”**

Tip: In posts, you can then write something like:  
> “Check out our new product in 3D – link in bio!”


---

### **Option 2: Use a link aggregator (e.g., Linktree)**

If you want to show multiple links (to several models or pages), you can use a service like **[Linktree](https://linktr.ee/)** or similar.

1. Create an account on Linktree  
2. Add your FOTO-3D link as one of the links  
3. Paste your Linktree address into your Instagram bio

### **Option 3: Share via Instagram Story (with link sticker)**

If you have a business account, you can add clickable links directly in Stories.

1. Create a Story (image/video)  
2. Tap the **Sticker icon** (square smiley)  
3. Select **“Link”**  
4. Paste your FOTO-3D link  
5. Add a clear label, e.g., *“View in 3D”* or *“Explore the product”*  
6. Publish

## Want to use Instagram ads?

You can also use your FOTO-3D link in ads via **Meta Ads Manager**, just like on Facebook. It works in both feed ads and Stories, and you can target ads to a selected audience.
