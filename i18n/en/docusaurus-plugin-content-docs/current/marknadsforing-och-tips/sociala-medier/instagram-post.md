# How to share FOTO-3D content on Instagram

Start by opening the page on your website where your Marvify FOTO-3D viewer is available and copy the full URL from your browser. This URL is the destination that viewers can visit after they see your Instagram post.

If your Marvify viewer is not yet set up on your website you can refer to the technical documentation and sample setup guide. These resources describe how to prepare a 3D experience that can be accessed from external platforms.

- [Sample setup guide](/en/exempel/webpage-integration)

Next, prepare the media that you want to post on Instagram. This can be a static image taken from the Marvify FOTO-3D viewer, a short video recording of the interaction, or another visual representation of the 3D content saved as an image or video file on your device.

Since Instagram feed posts do not support clickable links in the caption, the most common way to direct people to your 3D experience is to place the URL in your profile. To do this, open Instagram, go to your profile, select Edit profile, and paste the Marvify FOTO-3D URL in the Website field or another suitable link.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={require('@site/static/img/instagram-edit-profile.webp').default}
    alt="Click on links to add your link"
    style={{ width: '60%' }}
  />
  <em
    style={{
      display: 'block',
      marginTop: '0.5rem',
      fontSize: '0.9rem',
      color: '#666'
    }}
  >
    Click on links to add your link
  </em>
</p>

After the link is stored in your profile, create a new feed post. On Instagram, tap the create button and select Post. Choose the prepared image or video that shows your Marvify FOTO-3D content from your device gallery. Instagram Stories can also be used if you want a temporary post and these support adding a link sticker that viewers can tap to open the URL.

If you want to show multiple views of the same 3D experience you can create a carousel by selecting several images or videos in the same post. Instagram will display them as swipeable items in the feed.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={require('@site/static/img/instagram-feed-carousel.webp').default}
    alt="Choose one or more media for a post"
    style={{ width: '40%' }}
  />
  <em
    style={{
      display: 'block',
      marginTop: '0.5rem',
      fontSize: '0.9rem',
      color: '#666'
    }}
  >
    Choose one or more media for a post
  </em>
</p>

On the caption screen, write a description for the post. You can include instructions on how to access the 3D experience, such as referencing the link stored in your profile or providing the URL in plain text. Users can copy the URL manually if they want to open it in a browser.

Optionally, you can add the URL again as a comment under your own post. This does not make the link clickable in the feed but keeps the address visible in the comment thread.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src={require('@site/static/img/instagram-feed-caption.webp').default}
    alt="Add text and/or optional URL-information"
    style={{ width: '60%' }}
  />
  <em
    style={{
      display: 'block',
      marginTop: '0.5rem',
      fontSize: '0.9rem',
      color: '#666'
    }}
  >
    Add text and/or optional URL-information
  </em>
</p>

When you are done adjusting the caption and settings, publish the post to your Instagram feed. Followers who see the post can visit your profile and use the profile link to access the Marvify FOTO-3D page on your website.
