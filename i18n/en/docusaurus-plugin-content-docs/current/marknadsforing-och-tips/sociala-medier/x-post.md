# How to share FOTO-3D in a post on X

Begin by opening the page on your website where your Marvify FOTO-3D experience is hosted and copy the full link from your browser. This is the link you will include in your post on X.

If you do not yet have your Marvify viewer set up on your website, you can refer to our technical documentation and sample setup guide. These resources will help you prepare your 3D experience for sharing.

- [Sample setup guide](/en/exempel/webpage-integration)

Go to [x.com](https://x.com) or the X mobile app and sign in to the account you want to post from. On desktop, you will find the post composer at the top of the Home timeline, or by clicking the "Post" button. In the app, you can start a new post from the compose icon.

Click or tap into the composer and paste the link you copied earlier. X will process the link and, when supported for your account and link type, may generate a preview card showing an image, title and short description from your website. This card becomes the clickable element that leads to your 3D experience.

You can add any accompanying text you need in the same post. Links on X are automatically shortened, and you can optionally attach images or videos in addition to the link. When you are satisfied with the content, choose your audience settings if applicable and prepare to publish.

Once everything looks correct, publish the post. It will appear in your followers' timelines and anywhere else your post is shown, and clicking the link or its preview will take people directly to the Marvify FOTO-3D experience on your site.

## Troubleshooting: Missing preview card

If no preview card appears for your link, it usually means X does not have the information it needs from the webpage to build a card. This information is provided through metadata such as Open Graph and X-specific card tags, including `og:image`, `og:title`, `og:description`. These tags tell X which image and text to display alongside the link.

For more details about the Open Graph standard, see [the official Open Graph documentation](https://ogp.me/).

*Please note that X may update its interface, features or card behavior over time. The steps and visuals in this guide are intended as general guidance and may not always reflect the most recent version of the platform.*
