# How to create Facebook/Instagram ads with FOTO-3D

Begin by opening the page on your website where your Marvify FOTO-3D experience is located and copy the full link from your browser. This is the link you will use as the destination for your Facebook ad.

If you have not yet set up your Marvify viewer on your website, you can use our technical documentation and sample guide. These resources will help you prepare your 3D experience for use in ads.

- [Sample setup guide](/en/exempel/webpage-integration)

To create the ad, go to [Meta Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/tools/ads-manager) and choose to create a new campaign. Select an objective that sends people to your website, such as traffic or sales. This ensures the ad format supports a clickable link that leads directly to your 3D viewer page.

Continue to the ad set where you can define audience, placements, budget, and schedule according to your needs. Under placements, you can choose whether the ad should appear on Facebook, Instagram, or both, since both platforms use the same Ads Manager. These settings are flexible and can be adjusted according to your target audiences and markets. When this is complete, proceed to the ad itself.

In the ad settings, choose an ad format that works for you with a link, such as a single image or carousel format. In the website URL field, paste the link to your Marvify FOTO-3D page that you copied earlier. This URL is used as the destination when someone clicks on the ad.

You can then add primary text, headline, description, and a call to action button. These fields control how the ad appears in the feed and how the link is presented. The preview in Ads Manager shows what the ad will look like in different placements as you make changes.

When you are satisfied with the settings and preview, publish the campaign in Ads Manager. After review, Facebook will begin showing the ad and people who click will be sent directly to the 3D experience on your website where they can explore the product.

## Troubleshooting: Missing preview

If the preview in Ads Manager does not show the correct image or information for your link, it may be because your Open Graph tags are missing or outdated, such as `og:image`, `og:title`, and `og:description`. These tags help Facebook understand which image and text to display in link-based ads and previews.

For more information see: [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/).
