# How to share FOTO-3D in a Facebook post

Begin by opening the page on your website where your 3D experience is hosted and copy the full link from your browser. Having it copied ahead of time makes the process smoother.

If you do not yet have your Marvify viewer set up on your website, you can refer to our technical documentation and sample setup guide. These resources will help you prepare your 3D experience for sharing.

From there, head over to Facebook and switch into the profile or Page you want to post from. If you are working with a brand Page, make sure you are viewing that Page so the post is published in the right place. The post creation box will be waiting at the top of your feed.

Once you click or tap into that box, paste the link you copied earlier. Facebook will take a moment to load a preview. After it appears, you will see a small card with an image, title, and short description pulled from your website. This preview serves as the clickable link for anyone who views the post. If you prefer to remove the plain URL from the text field after the preview loads, the preview will remain active.

At this stage you can include additional text, images, or video if they are helpful for your post. These elements are optional, and Facebook allows you to publish the link card with or without them. If you are posting from a personal profile, you can choose who is allowed to see the post. Brand Pages usually publish publicly.

When everything looks correct and the preview displays the right information, publish the post. The link card will appear in the feed for your audience and will take them directly to the 3D experience on your site when they click or tap it.

## Troubleshooting: Missing link preview

If no preview appears when you paste your link into Facebook, it usually means the webpage is missing the information Facebook looks for when generating a link card. This information is provided through Open Graph tags, such as `og:image`, `og:title` and `og:description`. These tags tell Facebook which image and text to display in the preview.

For more details about the Open Graph standard, see [the official Open Graph documentation](https://ogp.me/).
