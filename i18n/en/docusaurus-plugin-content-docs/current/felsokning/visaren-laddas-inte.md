# Troubleshooting – Viewer Not Displaying

If your FOTO-3D© viewer isn't loading or displaying correctly, there are a few common things you can check yourself before contacting support.

## Checklist – Common Causes

### 1. **Is the Link Correct?**
Make sure you're using the correct URL. It should look like this:

```
https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>
```

Double-check that:
- The model ID is correct and doesn't contain any extra characters.
- There are no spaces or typos.
- You haven’t accidentally added HTML tags or extra quotation marks.

### 2. **Is Your Subscription Active?**
Viewers only work if the account has an active subscription.  
If you're unsure — contact us at [info@marvify.com](mailto:info@marvify.com) and we’ll help you check the status.

---

### 3. **Are You Using the Correct Protocol (https)?**
The page and the link need to use **https://** – not http://.  
Many browsers block content that is loaded without encryption.

---

### 4. **Is an Error Message Displayed?**
In some cases, a clear error message is shown in the viewer. Read the message carefully, it may give you a clue about what’s missing or incorrect.

## Tip: Check the Browser’s Developer Tools

If nothing appears at all, or you only see a blank space, you can try opening the browser’s **developer tools** to see if any errors are shown in the console.

Here’s how to do it in **Google Chrome**:

1. Right-click on the page where the viewer should appear
2. Select **“Inspect”**
3. Click the **“Console”** tab

If something is wrong — for example, if the link can’t be loaded — it will often show up here as an error message.

**Using a different browser?**  
These tools are also available in browsers like Firefox, Edge, and Safari — usually under menu options like “Web Developer Tools” or “Inspect Element.”

You don’t need to understand everything shown — but sometimes an error message can offer a clear clue about what needs to be fixed.
