## What is FOTO-3D?

FOTO-3D© is Marvify’s service for creating **photorealistic 3D models** of your products.
Starting from physical objects, we produce a digital replica that captures every detail including realistic shape, color, and texture.

The result is a **realistic and interactive experience**, accessible directly in the browser through a simple link.  
Your customers can view the product from every angle, zoom in, and explore it in a way that feels like holding it in their hands.


FOTO-3D© can be used across all types of digital communication:

- Product pages and e-commerce  
- Campaigns and landing pages  
- Social media posts and ads  
- Newsletters, blogs, and QR codes  
- Print materials and packaging

By using 3D, you create a strong visual experience that sparks interest, deepens product understanding, and strengthens your brand even before your customers have the product in their hands.
When customers know what to expect, the risk of misunderstandings, mistaken purchases, and unnecessary returns is significantly reduced.
