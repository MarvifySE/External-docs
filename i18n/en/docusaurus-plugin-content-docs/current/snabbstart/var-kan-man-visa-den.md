# Where can you display FOTO-3D?

The only real requirement is that the place where you share the link can be opened in a web browser – and that it allows clickable links or embedding.  
As long as it's possible to click a link or display a page in a browser, you can use PHOTO-3D© there. Simple!


---

## On the web

- On your **website** or **product page**
- In a **blog**, **article**, or **press release**
- As a **button**, **text link**, or **clickable image**
- Embedded in a layout using `<iframe>`

---

## In mailings

- Link in **email campaigns** and newsletters  
- As a link in a **personal email signature**  
- In internal messages or documents (intranet, onboarding, PDF)

---

## On social media

- On platforms like **Instagram**, **Facebook**, **LinkedIn**, **X**, and **TikTok**  
- In bio, posts, stories, or comments  
- Share directly or via link tools like Linktree

---

## In e-commerce

- Link on the **product page** in your online store  
- In product descriptions or near the buy button  
- Links are supported in platforms like **Shopify**, **WooCommerce**, **Squarespace**, **Magento**, **Webflow**, and others

---

## In printed material

- Create a **QR code** that links to the presentation  
- Use it on packaging, in-store materials, or trade show mailings  
- Add it to menus, labels, or signs

---

## And just about anywhere else

- In presentations and pitches  
- In digital catalogs or showrooms  
- In apps, portals, or internal tools

---

In short: if you can insert a link – then you can display FOTO-3D©.
