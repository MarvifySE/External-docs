# Packaging & Label

Want to connect your physical product to a digital experience?  
With Marvify FOTO-3D©, you can let customers explore the product in 3D – directly from the packaging.

---

## How is it used?

You can place a link to your 3D viewer on, for example:

- The product’s **label** or **packaging**  
- A **printed menu**, brochure, or in-store sign  
- A **display** in a store or showroom

The customer scans the link (or QR code) with their phone and opens the product in 3D, directly in the browser – no app needed.

---

## Which link should you use?

Use the direct link to your FOTO-3D model, for example:

```
https://v.marvify.io/?m=<modell-id>
```

For a more brand-aligned appearance, you can also use a **custom short link or domain** that redirects to the Marvify link.  
Example:

```
https://mybrand.com/snacks → https://v.marvify.io/?m=abc123
```


Alternatively, you can use a **URL shortening service** like:

- [bit.ly](https://bitly.com)  
- [tinyurl.com](https://tinyurl.com)

This makes the link shorter and easier to place in small spaces – perfect for labels.

## Add a QR code

The easiest way to make the link accessible to customers is to create a **QR code** that leads to the viewer.  
The QR code can be printed directly on packaging, stickers, menus, or signage.

See our guide: [Create a QR code »](./skapa-qr-kod.md)

## Packaging design tips

- Place the QR code where it’s easy to scan (avoid bends or folds)  
- Add a clear **call to action**, such as:  
  - *“Scan to view in 3D”*  
  - *“Explore the product digitally”*  
  - *“Look around the entire package before you buy”*  
- Test the QR code in advance – both on mobile and on printed materials

---

## Remember the subscription period

If you plan to print the link or QR code on a physical product, make sure that:

- Your **Marvify subscription is active** for the entire time the product is on the market  
- You don’t change or remove the model while the link is in use

This is especially important for longer campaigns or when materials are printed in large quantities.
