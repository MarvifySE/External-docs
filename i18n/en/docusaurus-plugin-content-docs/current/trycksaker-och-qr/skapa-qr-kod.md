# Create a QR code

A QR code makes it easy to share your FOTO-3D© viewer in printed form – for example on packaging, menus, posters, or business cards.

When the customer scans the QR code with their phone camera, the product opens directly in 3D, in the browser – no app needed.


---

## What you need

- A working FOTO-3D link, e.g.:  
  `https://v.marvify.io/?m=<model-id>`  
- A QR code generator (there are many free options available)

- Use an **SVG** version of the QR code for print (scalable without becoming blurry)  
- Place the QR code where it won’t be folded, shadowed, or disrupted by patterns  
- Add a short instruction below the code, such as:  
  - *“Scan to view in 3D”*  
  - *“Explore the product digitally”*
